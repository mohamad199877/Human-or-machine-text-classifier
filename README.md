# Text Classification: Machine-Generated vs. Human-Written

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying text as either machine-generated or human-written. We leverage both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques to achieve accurate classification. The dataset comprises text samples in English and Spanish.

## Dataset

- **English Dataset**: `subtask1_train_en.tsv`
- **Spanish Dataset**: `subtask1_train_es.tsv`

The dataset includes labeled text samples for training and evaluation.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Loading Data**: Utilized pandas to load TSV files and combine datasets.
- **Cleaning and Preparation**: Removed unnecessary columns and performed text cleaning (e.g., lowercasing, punctuation removal).
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted features like word count, character count, and unique word count. Implemented TF-IDF vectorization and Word2Vec embeddings.

### Model Training

- **Traditional Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Utilized TF-IDF and Word2Vec features.
  - **Naive Bayes**: Applied on TF-IDF features.
  - **Evaluation**: Metrics include classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - **BERT-based Model**: Fine-tuned Roberta for sequence classification.
  - **Tokenization**: Employed RobertaTokenizer for encoding text.
  - **Training**: Implemented a training loop with performance evaluation.

### Model Interpretation

- **LIME**: Used LIME to interpret model predictions and visualize feature importance.

## Code Examples

### Example Texts

```python
text1 = "I am a bit hungery and my boyfirend is still working, I wish he could coock for me but he is still working, meanwhile I will eat a banana"
text2 = "I am feeling a bit hungry and my boyfriend is still working. Although I wish he could cook for me, I understand he is still occupied. In the meantime, I will have a banana."
text3 = "I'm feeling a little hungry, and unfortunately, my boyfriend is still at work, so I wish he could prepare a meal for me. However, since he's still working, I'll have a banana in the meantime."

text4 = "there is this guy who is working on his project at 2 am in the night, instead of sleeping he is working very hard. He should go to sleep soon and he will go to sleep soon or he ll regret it tomorrow"
text5 = "There's a man diligently working on his project at 2 am, sacrificing sleep for his endeavor. It's crucial for him to rest soon, or he will inevitably face regret in the coming day."
text6 = "At 2 am in the night, there's an individual engrossed in his project, putting in tremendous effort instead of getting some sleep. It's imperative for him to prioritize rest and he will soon do so; otherwise, he'll experience regret tomorrow."

text7 = "hello my name is ALi and I AM WORKIng on this project, I am trying to figure out if my model can detect if this was written by me or by chat gpt. however this text is written by me and I am trying to type more and more so I can have a large text for my moder for it to be able to classify. again i repeat I wrote this text by myself I am going to have some spelling mistakes like this txt has some porblems!"
text8 = "Hello, my name is Ali, and I am working on a project. My goal is to determine whether my model can distinguish between text written by me and text generated by ChatGPT. However, this particular text has been written by me, and I am attempting to type more content to provide a substantial amount for my model to classify. I want to emphasize that I authored this text personally. Consequently, there might be some spelling errors and issues within this text, such as the presence of problems in this sentence."
text9 = "Greetings, my name is Ali, and I am actively engaged in a project. My objective is to determine whether my model can discern between text originating from me and text generated by ChatGPT. It is important to note that the current text has been personally composed by me, and my aim is to produce an extensive body of text to facilitate accurate classification by my model. Once again, I want to reiterate that I am the sole author of this text, and it is expected to contain some spelling errors, such as the presence of problems in this particular piece of text."
